# Mouse Following Blob

This project is a simple web page that displays a blob that follows the user's mouse cursor as it moves around the screen.

## Installation

To use the mouse following blob, simply clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/not-sample-text/mouse-following-blob.git` and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Usage

Once the mouse following blob is running, the blob will follow the user's mouse cursor as it moves around the screen. The blob moves smoothly and follows the cursor with a slight delay, making it look like it is following the cursor in a fluid motion.
