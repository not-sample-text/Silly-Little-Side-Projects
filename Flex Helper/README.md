# Flex Helper

This project aims to help newcomers to CSS understand how to use the flexbox layout. The project provides a simple interface with radio buttons to adjust the flex direction, alignment, and justification of a square element. The changes made using the radio buttons are reflected in real-time in the display of the square element.

# Getting Started

To use the Flex Helper, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The interface will be displayed, showing the square element and the radio buttons for adjusting its flex properties.

## Usage

The interface includes three sets of radio buttons, each controlling a different flex property of the square element:

    - Flex Direction: controls the direction of the flex container (either row or column).
    - Align Items: controls the alignment of flex items within the flex container.
    - Justify Content: controls the distribution of space between and around flex items along the main axis.

Simply click on a radio button to adjust the corresponding property of the square element. The changes will be immediately reflected in the display of the square element.
